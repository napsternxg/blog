        "\n",
        "Accuracy is a fundamental concept in evaluating every day systems. In simple terms, accuracy is defined as proportion of times the predictions of our system matched the true outcome (assuming the true outcome exists). For this post lets follow the scikit-learn convention and define `y_true` as the true outcome and `y_pred` as the predictions. \n",
        "\n",
        "In mathematical terms accuracy can be simply written as the mean value of the indicator function which is 1 when the `y_true == y_pred` and 0 otherwise.\n",
        "\n",
        "More consicely, this can be written as $accuracy(y_{true}, y_{pred}) = \\frac{1}{N} * \\sum_i \\mathbb{1}[y_{true} = y_{pred}]$.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Confusion Matrix\n",
        "\n",
        "Another popular way of computing accuracy is by using the confusion matrix. If our outcome classes can be enumerated as 0, 1, 2, ... then the confusion matrix $CM$ will contain elements $CM[i, j] = \\sum_i \\mathbb{1}[y_{true} = i \\land y_{pred} = j]$, i.e. count of the number of times $y_{true}$ was $i$ and $y_{pred}$ was $j$. \n",

        "A confusion matrix for binary classification (assuming $+$ as the positive class) may look as follows:\n",

        "\n",
        "| Term | Defition | Comments |\n",
        "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
        "| TP | True Positives | Number of times the $+$ class is predicted as $+$; correctly predicted as positive |\n",

        "This confusion matrix approach easily extends to multi-class cases and is quite helpful when defining Precision, Recall metrics as we will see below.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, Accuracy can be defined in terms of the confusion matrix as $accuracy = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + FP + FN + TN}$\n",
        "\n",
        "# Precison and Recall\n",
        "\n",
        "Precision and Recall are popular evaluation metrics used for evaluating classification systems and are very valuable when we have multiple classes and these classes are present with a skewed distribution in the data. \n",

        "\n",
        "However, I find this definition restrictive, i.e. this only works for binary classification use cases and for each new class we need to define a new confusion matrix. I also find this formulation difficult to remember. E.g. in my initial days of learning these definitions I often used to confuse False Positive and False Negatives. \n",
        "\n",
        " Furthermore, this also relies on the confusion matrix approach to compute the values, which has its benefits in terms of computational complexity as we can compute the confusion matrix once on a large dataset and compute all sorts of metrics on top of this. \n",

        " ## Precision Recall as filtered accuracies\n",
        "\n",
        " If you look at the confusion matrix above you will notice that precision is really defined as the ratio of $\\frac{CM[+, +]}{\\sum_{true~classes} CM[:, +]}$.\n",
        " \n",
        " This ratio can be stated $\\frac{correct~prediction~of~+_{class}}{all~the~ predictions~of~+_{class}}$. \n",
        "\n",
        " If you notice clearly, this is just the accuracy of the data limited to items predicted as $+_{class}$ or simply $precision(y_{true}, y_{pred}, class) = accuracy(y_{true}[y_{pred} = class], y_{pred}[y_{pred} = class])$, where $X[y=class]$ selects only those items from $X$ where $y=class$, we can $y = class$ as a filter or mask.\n",
        "\n",
        " Similarly, recall is $\\frac{CM[+, +]}{\\sum_{pred~classes} CM[+, :]}$ or $\\frac{correct~prediction~of~+_{class}}{all~the~items~of~+_{class}}$ or $recall(y_{true}, y_{pred}, class) = accuracy(y_{true}[y_{true} = class], y_{pred}[y_{true} = class])$. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " So if you look closely, you will notice that precision and recall only differ in the filter used to send data to accuracy. Precision uses the filter $[y_{pred} = +]$ while recall uses the filter $[y_{true} = +]$.\n",
        "\n",
        " Furthermore, we can see that if we swap the arguments to precision or recall we get the value for the other, i.e. $precision(y_{true}, \\boldsymbol{y_{pred}}, class) = recall(\\boldsymbol{y_{pred}}, y_{true}, class)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " Furthermore, this definition can easily be extended to multi class setting where you simply need to replace $+$ with the new class."
